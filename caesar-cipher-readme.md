The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate securely with his generals. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
The first kind of cipher you are going to build is called a Caesar cipher. Specifically, you will take each letter in your message,
find its position in the alphabet, take the letter located after 3 positions in the alphabet, and replace the original letter with the new letter.
